# [randompassword.app](https://randompassword.app)

This is a mini-project that I use at least once per week. Generates a random string for when password manager(s) fail to display a "Suggest Strong Password"/"Generate Password" prompt.

I find that iCloud Keychain, Google Chrome Password Manager, and 1Password often compete for control of login and signup forms — this solves a frequent headache when creating new accounts or changing passwords.

<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> will select only the password.
